This is a simple patcher for [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/) that allows you to bypass the license check.   
It works by patching the license check functions in the binary to accept any license key.

## Usage

1. Compile the patcher using `make`, `cmake`, or your favorite C++ compiler.
2. Run the patcher with the path to the `sublime_text` or `sublime_merge` binary as the first argument.
3. If the patch was successful, the binary will be backed up with a `.bak` extension.
4. Run Sublime Text or Sublime Merge and enter any license key.
5. Enjoy!

The patcher has a few CLI options:

- `-h`, `--help`: Show the help message
- `-s`, `--scan-fs`: Scan filesystem for Sublime binaries
- `-l`, `--log-level`: Set log level (trace, debug, info, warn, error, critical)
- `-b`, `--no-backup`: Do not create a backup of the original binary

By default, it will only check the current directory for the binary.  
Using the `-s` option will try and locate the binary in the default expected locations.  
_Paths documented in [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/command_line.html) and [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/docs/command_line) CLI documentation._

If you want to revert the patch, simply delete the patched binary and rename the backup to the original name.

## Pre-built Binaries

If you don't want to build from source, each commit is built by a GitHub Actions workflow and artifacts are available for download.   
You can download the latest artifacts from the [GitHub Actions page](https://github.com/Big-Iron-Cheems/sublime-patcher/actions) by:

1. Selecting the most recent successful workflow run
2. Scrolling down to the "Artifacts" section
3. Downloading the appropriate binary for your platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux)

_Note: A GitHub account is required to download the artifacts._

## Supported versions

The patcher has been tested with Sublime Text 4 and Sublime Merge 2.   
It works on the Windows, macOS, and Linux editions.

If you encounter any issues, please open an issue or a pull request.  
Be sure to mention the version of Sublime Text or Sublime Merge you are using, and your operating system.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you have any improvements or bug fixes, feel free to open a pull request.  
Make sure to follow the style of the existing code (as set by `.clang-format`), and to test your changes.
